# Contributing to MedChain

We welcome contributions to the MedChain Healthcare Supply Chain Management System! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/medchain.git
   cd medchain
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Set up the database**:
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   npm run db:seed
   ```
5. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming
- `feature/feature-name` - for new features
- `bugfix/bug-description` - for bug fixes
- `docs/documentation-update` - for documentation changes
- `refactor/component-name` - for code refactoring

### Making Changes

1. **Create a new branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the coding standards below

3. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   npm run test
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript/JavaScript
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Prefer functional programming patterns

### React Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the existing component structure
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use React Query for data fetching

### Database
- Use Drizzle ORM for all database operations
- Follow the existing schema patterns
- Add proper foreign key relationships
- Use transactions for multi-table operations
- Add appropriate indexes for performance

### API Design
- Follow RESTful conventions
- Use proper HTTP status codes
- Implement proper error handling
- Add input validation with Zod
- Use role-based access control

## Testing

### Unit Tests
```bash
npm run test:unit
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
npm run test:integration
```

### E2E Tests
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

## Code Review Process

1. **All contributions** must be submitted via Pull Request
2. **At least one review** is required before merging
3. **All tests** must pass
4. **Code coverage** should not decrease
5. **Documentation** must be updated if needed
